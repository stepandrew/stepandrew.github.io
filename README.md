## Welcome to Anna's CSHU250 Practice  

Your classes are fantastic!!
> - Anna 

This class is about to learn version control. I followed this practice from my class assignment module 4 that make practice several tutorials to get familiar with github.

I used the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/stepandrew/stepandrew.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for my website in Markdown files.

Whenever I **commit** to this repository, *GitHub* Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in my site, from the content in my Markdown files. [link to Google!](http://google.com)

I praticed this page by edit and commit channge.
Here is the image from Github images. I mentioned inside the **Markdown**

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/stepandrew/stepandrew.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
